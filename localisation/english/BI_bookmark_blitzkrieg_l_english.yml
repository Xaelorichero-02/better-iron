 SWI_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Switzerland was in a tense situation even before the Anschluss, but now that the German Reich has had a taste of easy expansion into other German-speaking territories, there's a real danger this peaceful Alpine nation is next. Now more than ever the absolute neutrality of Switzerland will be tested, and if everything goes wrong, perhaps even its defenses."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Blitzkrieg"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan. The new non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany may be bad news for the rest of Europe."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Munich agreement a year ago. However, German territorial expansion has made Italy see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germans could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
 CAN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a mere colony and left it as a nation. Born in the mud of Passchendaele, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled by the Great Depression and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"
 SAF_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of the Great War chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendants of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the western front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the people of New Zealand look anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
 RAJ_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
 HUN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "One half of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary was treated as a defeated enemy by the victorious Entente after the Great War. In the Treaty of Trianon, the country lost almost two thirds of its territory. Millions of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside its borders, and its economy was left in ruins. Harsh restrictions on rearmament were supposed to ensure that Hungary could never again threaten the peace in Europe. \n\nBut with the political climate in Europe shifting, the time may have come to finally right the wrongs of the past, and regain the former glory of the nation."
 ROM_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Romania found herself on the winning side of the Great War, and as a result gained new territories and people - not all of whom were Romanians. To guard against the revanchist desires of the countries that were forced to cede land, Romania has created a web of alliances all across the Balkans. In recent years, however, the country has concerned itself mostly with domestic matters, and the government of King Carol II has allowed these alliances to lapse. \n\nAs the political situation in Europe changes, Romania may well find herself standing alone - and vulnerable."
 YUG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Yugoslavia came into existence after the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes merged with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia in 1922. Initially Yugoslavia joined both the Little Entente and the Balkan Pact to secure their independence, but recently growing internal pressure from nationalists and external pressure from Italy and Germany has caused drastic upheaval and reevaluation of their political and strategic position."
 CHI_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After two years of war against the Japanese, the armies of Chiang Kai-Shek have bled themselves white trying to stop the assault. The enemy has overrun the richest areas of the country. Little support has been forthcoming from the western democracies, and the Communist seem unwilling to engage the enemy in open battle.\n\nWith the war threatening to spread even further, it appears that the worst is still to come. But as the Japanese attack is slowed by the vastness of the country, they may well turn their gaze in other directions, and new alliances may yet turn the tide..."
 PRC_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Faced with an all-out Japanese attack, the Nationalists and Communists have struck an uneasy truce. Both sides are well aware that this United Front can not last. The Communist base area in Yan'an now forms the front line in the war against the Japanese.\n\nThe Communists must husband their resources carefully if they want to survive. Any casualties suffered in the fight against Japan will be felt twice over when the time comes to fight the war against the Nationalists, and this may well be what the government of Chiang Kai-Shek is counting on..."
 MAN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Evicted from the Dragon Throne at the age of six, Puyi, the last Chinese Emperor, has been biding his time. While his former realm tore itself apart in the Chinese Civil War, Puyi found new allies in Japan.\n\nFor Puyi, the establishment of the Empire of Manchukuo in 1932 was but the first step in the quest to reclaim his ancestral birthright. For the moment, he is dependent on the Japanese Army to keep his rule, but in time, an opportunity might arise to cast off the shackles of servitude and become what he was born to be..."
 WARLORDS_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:1 "The war with Japan has forced the Chinese Warlords to pick a side, but there can be no doubt that this alliance is living on borrowed time. The day will come when it has outlived its usefullness, and on that day the game is once again open for every man ambitious and ruthless enough to make a play for the title of Ruler of China."
 MEXICO_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The government of Lázaro Cárdenas has shown itself to be a bigger force for positive social change than that of his predecessor President Plutarco Calles, who has now been exiled to America. With the economic situation stabilized and the foreign oil firms brought under the custodianship of the state, the Mexican government can begin to look outwards. America faces enemies on many fronts and will likely forgive the nationalization of Standard Oil, but those enemies may be even more lucrative to befriend..."
 NETHERLANDS_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War between Germany and the other European major powers seems inevitable, and though the Netherlands has put its faith once again in its neutrality, its leaders are contemplating making secret staff plans with their southern neighbors in preparation for possible hostilities.\n\nThe army has been mobilized, and work on the Dutch defensive lines is increasing in pace in an attempt to get the country as ready as possible to defend against any infringement of its sovereignty. Should this fail, there are always the colonies..."
 SPAIN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The civil war that has devastated the country for the past three years has finally concluded. Under the guidance of Franco, the victors must now see to Spain's recovery, the elimination of remaining pockets of resistance, and the mending of the divides created by the war.\n\nTime is not unlimited, however, as the world at large continues its inexorable march towards what will undoubtedly be a far larger and still more bloody war. If Spain is to stand its ground, let alone reap the fruits of opportunity presented by this coming conflict, it must ready its industry and its military without delay."
 PORTUGAL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The conservative government of Salazar allowed Portugal to remain neutral during the Spanish Civil War while actively supporting the Nationalists, thus ensuring the defeat of the Communists and the Anarchists. \n\nNow that the Iberian Peninsula has finally found stability, it is time to look abroad for potential allies and consider the role that Portugal will play on the seemingly inevitable world conflict."
 LIT_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The stage is set. Antanas Smetona has secured the dictatorship and the dreams of restoring a Lithuanian Republic are well beyond reach. An agreement has been struck with the Soviets to return Vilnius to Lithuania upon the partition of Poland, but just how much can Smetona trust Stalin and his thirsty war machine to respect Lithuanian sovereignty indefinitely?"
 LAT_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Latvia’s over-reliance on Soviet trade has at last come back to bite the dictatorship in the neck. The Soviet Union and the German Reich have shown their teeth and are breathing down the neck of Ulmanis. Rapid mobilization is necessary if Latvian independence is to be preserved, unless the dictatorship would rather cower and beg the Soviets for mercy..."
 EST_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Estonia is trapped between the Red Menace to the East and the sea, and finds herself without the aid of her past allies. Though capitulation appears inevitable, the Estonian nation may persevere; either as a slave to the USSR or as an underground resistance fighting from the forests."
 BUL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "For the past few years, Tsar Boris has consolidated his power, dissolving the conspiratorial organization of Zveno and reorienting Bulgarian international politics towards Germany. Recent negotiations with the Balkan neighbors saw the UK lift the military restrictions imposed on the country after the Great War, in the hope of preventing Bulgaria from aligning with the Axis powers. \nNow the Tsar seeks to retrieve the territories lost in the past without dragging the country into a new conflict, but with international tension growing in Europe, it remains to be seen what the future holds for Bulgaria..."
 GRE_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Under the strong hand of dictator Ioannis Metaxas, stability has been restored to Greece. The Four Year Plan has allowed Greece’s industrial base to grow immensely over the last few years, and the country’s debt - while still inordinately high - appears to be somewhat manageable. \n\nUnfortunately, strong government and sensible economic policy might avail this imperiled nation for naught. A great and terrible war looms on the horizon, and despite Metaxas’ firm insistence that Greece shall maintain its neutrality throughout any possible future conflict, the decision might ultimately not be his to make..."
 TUR_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Father of the Turks, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, has passed away. Turkey is a nation in mourning, led now by esteemed statesman İsmet İnönü. İnönü inherits a fractured country whose divisions have been made all the more apparent by the death of its guiding light. \n\nDomestic concerns aside, İnönü also faces the prospect of a war in Europe that threatens to surpass even the Great War in terms of devastation. Atatürk often touted the mantra, “Peace at Home, Peace in the World.” Can İnönü hope to keep the peace during these turbulent times?"
 FIN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Finland finds itself caught between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, with tensions between the two powers on the rise. Negotiations with the Soviet Union have broken down and the government now faces difficult decisions about how to protect their country's sovereignty. \n\nEfforts have been made to strengthen Finnish defenses, but the army is still poorly equipped, and the air force and navy are virtually non-existent. Despite this, Finland's strong sense of national pride and military valor gives it a fierce determination to protect its independence."
 SWE_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rumblings of another Great War grow louder by the day as Germany erodes the borders of their neighbors. With the militaristic power being dependent on Swedish iron ore, fears are increasing that their territorial ambitions may soon spread beyond the Baltic and into Scandinavia. \n\nIn anticipation of such a threat, the Swedish military has begun to rearm and modernize thanks to the nation's burgeoning defense industry. All that remains to be seen is whether the nation is capable of deterring an invasion."
 NOR_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "As the Third Reich grows in power and size, fascist elements inside Norway seem poised to take advantage of a possible German Invasion to seize control of the country and collaborate with the enemy.\n\nVidkun Quisling, an unscrupulous lackey of the Nazi Party seems to be conspiring to gain power for himself and his party Nasjonal Samling. It is time for hasty preparations to begin, and for Norway to stand together to fend off the dangers that lurk within and without."
 DEN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Denmark is in a precarious situation with a neglected military that has seen budget cuts year after year in an effort to appease the much larger and stronger neighbor, Germany. \n\nAppeasements, however, have not hindered the German Reich from consolidating its power in Europe and laying claim to other nations. Denmark must now put its faith in its declaration of neutrality, which saved them from the disastrous Great War."
 BRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Getúlio Vargas has seized control of the government and suspended the democratic process. With his grip on power secured for the time being, the Brazilian leader now turns his attention to international affairs. War in Europe seems inevitable and paranoia over an Argentinian incursion into Brazilian territory is on the mind of the nation's leadership. But there is hope that alignment with the United States could help secure Brazil's future."
 ARG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Through the most fraudulent election in Argentinian history, the Concordancia continue to hold a majority in government with Roberto María Ortiz now running the country as its president. \n\nHowever as tensions rise between Argentina’s two closest friends in Europe, the country must now prepare for the inevitability of being torn between two factions. Not only that, discontent in the military grows, and paranoia is constantly stoked about their ever slumbering rival in the north. Argentina stands at a major crossroads, and must think carefully on how to react."
 CHL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "With the Jorge González von Marées and his fellow Nacistas coup attempt having been recently dealt with, Arturo Alessandri has stepped down and Pedro Aguirre Cerda has been elected the new President of Chile. The military threat still looms closely however, and it seems imminent that General Ariosto Herrera and his supporters attempt their own coup d'etat. \n\nWar also looms above the horizon, as tensions rise not only in Europe and Asia, but in the Amazon, close to the Chilean heartland."
 PAR_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "While Paraguay's current situation has improved significantly compared to just 3 years ago. There's still no denying that the current situation is far from ideal. The current Liberal rule has been heavily criticized by many, and the promises that have been done prior to assuming power have not been accomplished. \n\nWill Paraguay be able to pull through and prevail?"
 URG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The world is at its tipping point, and it is unknown as to what is going to happen. Many are speculating that Terra's final days as dictator are coming to a close and that we will once again get elections. Others are saying that he will continue as dictator until he dies. \n\nWhichever one occurs, let's just hope it's for the better."
