 chi.1.d:0 "Today a bomb was detoned in a meeting between the members of the Kuomintang. The explosion killed Chiang Kai-Shek instantly and injured Wang Jingwei, who was transported to the nearest hospital in hope he survives. An investigation has already began aiming to find out who did it, though people has already blamed the communists of Yan'an."
 chi.1.a:0 "Call Dai Li and Chen Cheng, now!"
 chi.2.d:0 "After what happened to Chiang Kai-Shek, some people in the Kuomintang were suggesting something that the generalissimo would have never let happen: Negotiate with the communists of Yan'an. It would stop these pointless attacks between our own people, and if we are lucky we might even manage to, finally, unificate our nation."
 chi.2.a:0 "We will make our best efforts."
 chi.3.d:0 "Following the terrorist attack in Nanking, Chen Cheng and Dai Li discussed the fate of the Chinese government. After a long meeting between them and other members of the Kuomintang, they decided to appoint Dai Li as the leader of the country. Well known for his anti-communism and fascist sympathies, many think its the only solution for the communist problem in the north."
 chi.3.a:0 "The general invites you to lake Tai."
 chi.4.d:0 "After the bombing made in Naking by infiltrated members of our army succeded, Chiang was assassinated, provoking the rise of Wang Jingwei, former leader of the left Kuomintang and close friend of Sun Yat Sen. Now he has reached our government with a proposal to end this madness of a civil war and work together for a better future in China. Some leaders of the party like Mao Zedong have already shown their disavowal for this proposition, while others like Zhang Lan have agreed with Wang Ming in order to stop this unending civil war."
 chi.4.a:0 "For a better future!"
 chi.4.b:0 "We won't negotiate with counter-revolutionaries."
 chi.5.d:0 "[PRC.GetLeader] has accepted the reunification proposal. Finally after years of conflict, the civil war has ended."
 chi.5.a:0 "For a better future!"
 chi.6.d:0 "[PRC.GetLeader] has refused to our proposal, stating that it's only a trap to purge the communists just like Chiang did in 1927. Reports form Xian state that the communist guerrillas have began attacking our garrisons, and Dai Li has arrived Wuhan with a report stating that a great scism is now happening in Yan'an, as well as a mass army defection in support of our cause."
 chi.6.a:0 "It's now or never!"
 chi.7.d:0 "Today the Chinese government has offered us protection and the status of autonomous region if we join their administration. While some think that we won't gain anything from this deal, others say that it's the only opportunity we have to prevent an inevitable invasion by them that we wouldn't be able to defeat."
 chi.7.a:0 "We have no other choice."
 chi.7.b:0 "We should be more optimistic."
 chi.8.d:0 "The government of Xinjiang has accepted our terms, we will begin the annexation of the region today."
 chi.8.a:0 "Perfect."
 chi.9.d:0 "The government of Xinjiang has refused our proposal, it's time to teach them a lesson."
 chi.9.a:0 "Let's go."
 chi.10.d:0 "We just recieved a message from Nanjing promising us a great future and a fair amount of autonomy if we join them. While it seems like a good offer and would impede an invasion that we may not be able to repel, there is still a possibility that they backdown."
 chi.10.a:0 "If we refuse they will invade us, don't they?"
 chi.10.b:0 "How cute of them! Let's respond with an outright no!"
 chi.11.d:0 "The government of Yunnan asked us to transfer the control of the region of Sichuan to them. It seems like we would not get any benefit from this, we would loose manpower, resources and factories, but what if we let the Yunnanese have Sichuan in exchange of increase our influence over their economy and army? They would get Sichuan but we wouldn't loose total control over it."
 chi.11.a:0 "Send the counter offer."
 chi.11.b:0 "Let them have it for free."
 chi.11.c:0 "Are they crazy?"
 chi.12.d:0 "The government of Nanjing has offered us another deal, they will hand us Sichuan if we become their satelite state, giving them control of some of our factories, divisions and resources. How should we respond?"

 chi.15.a:0 "All to defeat Nanjing."
 chi.15.b:0 "Why would we ally with some rocks over a mountain?"
 chi.16.d:0 "Yan'an has agreed to our proposal, now let's prepare to strike against Nanjing!"

 chi.17.d:0 "The government of Yan'an has refused to our deal."
 chi.17.a:0 "This is not the last thing they will hear of us."
 chi.18.d:0 "Today the Yunnanese Transport Enterprise finished the Burma-Sichuan road, greatly increasing our infrastructure in the region."
 chi.18.a:0 "How nice of them!"
 chi.19.d:0 "Today the government of Xibei San Ma asked us a favor: Not to interviene in their current conflict with Tibet. The British government dragged us in their last war against Tibet in 1932, which fortunately ended with the Ma Clique backing down. However, now they have resumed their conflicts with the Tibetans, but unlike in the Qinghai-Tibet war, now the fascist nations of Germany and Italy are menacing Europe with another world war, and if there is war in Europe, there is war in India. We shall not create unnecessary fronts."
 chi.19.a:0 "Let them have their beloved dessert."
 chi.20.d:0 "Today the Ma government has demanded our subjugation, saying that the only way of stopping the Tibetan insurrections is by having total control over our population. If we refuse, we will be met by war, one that we won't be able to easily win, and unlike the Qinghai-Tibet war of 1932, we won't have any British support if we get pushed back. How should we respond?"
 chi.20.a:0 "We have no option..."
 chi.20.b:0 "We shall die with honor, or live with glory!"
 chi.21.d:0 "The Tibetans have accepted our ultimatum, we will send our army to enter Lhasa tomorrow."

 chi.22.a:0 "We will have no mercy."
 chi.23.d:0 "Today the government of Sinkiang approached us asking for help against their invaders in the war. Helping them might seem easy, but at the moment our army is not well supplied and our population would not stand another stalemate like in our intervention in the region in 1934. Should we answer to their call?"
 chi.23.a:0 "Let's do this quickly."
 chi.23.b:0 "Maybe we could just send them some guns?"
 chi.24.d:0 "Following the liberation of Alma-ata, we run into a gulag full of people of many ethnicies. They were dirty, seemed exhausted and some of them even appeared to be malnourished. Among them, was an Asian man with a long, shabby beard who spoke to our soldiers from the other side of the fences. He said that he was a general of the Ma army and fought in the Soviet invasion of Xinjiang, and asked us to speak to one of our generals or officicers, however, he could just be a madman or be lying in order to be liberated from his prision. What should we do?"
 chi.24.a:0 "Let's make a meeting with him."
 chi.24.b:0 "He must be crazy. He will be liberated along with the rest when we reach Moscow."
 chi.25.d:0 "After one of our generals met with the man, we discovered something incredible: That weak and dirty man was Ma Zhongying, a general from the Ma Clique who disappeared in 1934 in the Soviet invasion of Xinjiang. After confirming his identity, he was taken into a plane by our forces and driven to the capital, were he would be able to recover. The pilot said that Ma Zhongying spent most of the travel cursing the Soviets, Stalin and communism, as well as saying how much he wanted to go to the front again to seek for his vengeance."
 chi.25.a:0 "Welcome back, mate."
 chi.26.d:0 "Today the Ma government has demanded collaboration with their government. Now that they have went into a campaign of liberating Central Asia, it was only a matter of time until they forced us to choose a side. What should we do?"

 chi.26.b:0 "Let them come if they dare."
 chi.27.d:0 "The Persian government has agreed to our terms, we can now enter their territory and command their army if needed."
 chi.27.a:0 "Perfect."
 chi.28.d:0 "The Persian government has refused to our demands. Ma Hushan is totally angered by the situation and has declared that the Persians will have to prepare their army if they want to keep their independence."
 chi.28.a:0 "Let's mobilize our forces."
 chi.29.d:0 "Today the government of Xinjiang occupied Tunganistan, conquered by us after the Soviet invasion of Xinjiang. At the moment we have other concerns more important than some empty and useless deserts, but it doesn't mean we will forget this insult to our clique."
 chi.29.a:0 "We will come after them later."
 chi.30.d:0 "The government of Guangxi asked us to transfer the control of the region of Hunan to them. It seems like we would not get any benefit from this, we would loose manpower, resources and factories, but what if we let Guangxi have Hunan in exchange of increase our influence over their economy and army? They would get Hunan but we wouldn't loose total control over it."
 chi.30.a:0 "Send the counter offer."
 chi.30.b:0 "Let them have it for free."
 chi.30.c:0 "Are they crazy?"
 chi.31.d:0 "The government of Nanjing has offered us another deal, they will hand us Hunan if we become their satelite state, giving them control of some of our factories, divisions and resources. How should we respond?"

 chi.32.a:0 "It's their loss."
 chi.33.d:0 "Today the government of Yue sent their army to occupy our undefended port in China, taking advantage of our dire situation. After the invasion of our colony, they sent us a message in which they stated that they could not tolerate having subjugated Yue right next to them, but that in order to reach an agreement, they would promise not to do anything to our enterprises and citizens staying there, as well as right to pass through their territories if needed. How should we respond?"
 chi.33.a:0 "We shall begin negotiations about this matter."
 chi.33.b:0 "Our navy is ready."
 chi.34.d:0 "Zhao Hengti as well as Chen Jiongming used to be an advocate of a federalist constitution, but after being deposed from his governance of Hunnan by Tang Shengzhi, who was being supported by Chiang Kai-shek, Zhao would quit the army, and politics. However, today generals of the Guangxi Clique decided to call Zhao Hengti back, action that was seen as treason by Li Zongren and his most loyal general, Bai Chongxi. The two caudillos would then send their troops to arrest Zhao and the generals who supported him, starting again a civil war in southern China."
 chi.34.a:0 "We shall never surrender!"
 chi.35.d:0 "Today we recieved a message from the Federated Provinces of China, proposing us a deal in which we would join their administration in exchange of becoming an autonomous region after they defeat the government of Nanjing. The promised autonomy seems like a good prize, even more if we think about the plans of reunification of Nanjing and Yan'an. How should we respond?"
 chi.35.a:0 "Seems like a fair deal."
 chi.35.b:0 "Thanks, but no."
 chi.36.d:0 "The Federated Provinces of China have offered us to enter their union, promising the status of autonomous region. In their message they also stated that they were doing their best efforts to reunite the nation peacefully, but that they would be forced to reunite it by force if we refused. What should we do?"

 chi.37.a:0 "Weng Wenhao, the geologist!"
 chi.37.b:0 "Zhao Hengti, the federalist general!"
 chi.38.d:0 "Today the Chinese government approached us with a deal: Creating an autonomous region controlled by China in our treaty port, region which will grant military access to our army and navy. This might be a benefit if we think about the fact that China would be able to help us protect the ports from our enemies, but in the other hand it might just be a trick... How should we respond?"
 chi.38.a:0 "Seems like a fair proposition."
 chi.38.b:0 "They will not dare to take it."
 chi.39.d:0 "After the defeat in the Federalist-Guangxi war, Li Zongren, old warlord of the clique, and Bai Chongxi, his most loyal general, crossed our border along with 12000 exhausted and under-equipped soldiers. Long Yun decided to recieve them and integrate them in the army, hoping that they don't aim to cause any problems."
 chi.39.a:0 "A free general is a free general."
 chi.40.d:0 "Today Ryukichi Tanaka, a Japanese chief of staff and friend of Yan Xishan, met with him in order to convince him to join Japan in an anti-communist alliance. Yan asked to all the Japanese troops to leave Shanxi and a great amount of money in exchange of an alliance, which will be only against the communist governments of China. Now the only thing to do is to wait."
 chi.40.a:0 "Maybe we will get something good out of this."
 chi.41.d:0 "Ryukichi Tanaka, one of our chief of staff fighting in the Chinese front with Shanxi, came to us with a delegate from Yan Xishan, telling us that after a meeting with the general, he was willing to enact an alliance with us, in exchange of an amount of money and the retreat of our forces from his territory. While it may seem like we would get no benefit from this, not having to care about defending Mengkukuo from the Chinese might free some of our forces, and let us prepare more naval invasions. However, it seems like the general is not very convinced about our intentions, so he might change his mind about joining us, but for the good of his people, it's likely that he would not attack us again in case of enacting a truce with us. How should we respond?."
 chi.41.a:0 "It is worth the money."
 chi.41.b:0 "A truce would benefit us both."
 chi.41.c:0 "We won't negotiate with inferiors."
 chi.42.d:0 "To our suprise, the government of Japan accepted our proposal to join their faction, and assured that they would pay the demanded amount of money at the moment we joined them. However, Yan Xishan doesn't seem too convinced, and thinks it is all a trap of the Japanese to take military control of the zone, how should we respond?"
 chi.42.a:0 "Better dishonor than death."
 chi.42.b:0 "A truce will be enough."
 chi.43.d:0 "Today the government of Shanxi asked us for a general to command their forces in order to improve the quality of their army. Some people among our government proposed to send Sadao Araki, the leader of the Kodoha faction, to help them, while others proposed Yoshijiro Umezu, a member of the Toseiha faction. However, we could also just refuse to send any."
 chi.43.a:0 "Sadao Araki might help them."
 chi.43.b:0 "Yoshijiro Umezu will do a great job."
 chi.43.c:0 "Do they think we are a general shop or something?"
 chi.44.d:0 "Due to the ever increasing conflicts between the CPC and Shanxi, today a guerrilla force was sent to Taiyuan with the objective of assassinating Yan Xishan and taking control over the region. Fortunately they did not succed in killing him, but they provoked a full scale uprising all over Shanxi, commanded by Zhou Enlai, which after Yan Xishan escaped to Beijing, took power over the clique. After noticing their defeat was evident, the remaining generals scaped to Beijing as well, where they probably would join the Nanjing forces as soon as possible."
 chi.44.a:0 "The revolution has succeded!"
 chi.45.d:0 "Due to the ever increasing conflicts between the CPC and Shanxi, today a guerrilla force was sent to Taiyuan with the objective of assassinating Yan Xishan and taking control over the region. Fortunately they did not succed in killing him, but they provoked a full scale uprising all over Shanxi, commanded by Zhou Enlai, which after Yan Xishan escaped to Beijing, took power over the clique. After noticing their defeat was evident, the remaining generals scaped to Beijing as well, to then join our forces in Nanjing."
 chi.45.a:0 "We will rescue your homes from the claws of the communists, whatever it takes."
 chi.46.d:0 "Just like the first coup organized by the Russian Guihua in 1933 against Jin Shuren, the Guihua cavalry corps have taken control over the country to end the tyranny of Sheng Shicai. After succeding at invading the capital and killing the few chinese guards protecting the palace, they captured Sheng Shicai and excecuted him in the streets of Urumqi. Finally, they appointed Ma Shaowu, a renowed general member of the Kuomintang, as the new leader of the nation."
 chi.46.a:0 "Will this provoke a second Russian intervention in Xinjiang?"
 chi.47.d:0 "Today the government of Sinkiang has arrested our advisors, following their new anti-communist stance. Invading them might seem easy, but at the moment our army is not well supplied and our population would not stand another stalemate like in our intervention in the region in 1934. How should we respond?"
 chi.47.a:0 "Let's do this quickly."
 chi.47.b:0 "Just issue a diplomatic protest."
 chi.48.d:0 "Today Ma Shaowu approached our government with an interesting proposal: Uniting our administrations as well as our armed forces. While it may seem that there are no downsides to this action, maybe it would be better for us to have them as our vassal, instead of a brother..."
 chi.48.a:0 "We'll be stronger together."
 chi.48.b:0 "We have other plans for Xinjiang..."
 chi.49.d:0 "Today the Ma clique approached our government with an interesting proposal: Uniting our administrations as well as our armed forces. While it may provide us protection against Moscow, it would mean to sacrifice our independence."
 chi.49.a:0 "We'll be stronger together."
 chi.49.b:0 "We appreciate our liberty."
 chi.50.d:0 "Early this week, prince Mehmed Abdülkerim Efendi of the Ottoman house arrived Sinkiang to take power of the nation, after being appointed as the new leader by the Guihua corps. Some people among the government began proposing the idea of uniting our nations, so we become stronger and are able to better defend ourselves from the Russians, strategy that obiously would cost part of our autonomy. This decision remains in the king's hands, should we join the new Ottoman Empire?"
 chi.50.a:0 "Let's hope it doesn't collapses again."
 chi.50.b:0 "What a stupid idea."
 chi.51.d:0 "The government of Afganistan congratulated us for the coronation of Mehmed Abdülkerim Efendi, and to celebrate, they proposed a union between our two nations. People was astonished by this proposition, but the sultan along with the Guihua corps decided that it would benefit us both to enact this union."
 chi.51.a:0 "The Ottoman Empire grows stronger!"
 chi.52.d:0 "Today the government of Sinkiang, now known as the Ottoman Empire, has excecuted our advisors, following their new anti-communist stance. Our people is strongly demanding our government to punish the Ottomans, and not doing so would surely anger them. Nonetheless, the decision remains in our great leader's hands."
 chi.52.a:0 "They will regret ever existing!"
 chi.52.b:0 "What would we gain from invading a couple of mountains in a desert?."
 chi.53.d:0 "Today a delegation from the Russian government of Sinkiang arrived our country with a message they wanted us to keep in secret. White guerrillas are currently preparing a coup in Eastern Russia, taking control of all the states between Kamchatka and Krasnoyarsk. They invite us to join them in their war against Moscow when the revolt ignites, however they have told us that the revolution is still in preparation, but they will notify us 120 days before the coup begins."
 chi.53.a:0 "We will take their offer into consideration."
 chi.54.d:0 "The Second Russian Civil War began after exiled White Russians and Japanese attaches ignited a revolt in Eastern Russia. Due to our country being currently almost encircled by the White forces, our government has broken our alliances with Moscow to preserve our independence and impede the loss of Mongolian lives in a battle that does not benefit us. However, some people have seen this as an opportunity to occupy Tannu Tuva, while others think that it would just anger the Soviets, provoking them to invade our country." 
 chi.54.a:0 "Nobody will notice it's gone."
 chi.54.b:0 "Let's not take a side in this conflict."
 chi.55.d:0 "Today we recieved the message from the White Russian government in Sinkiang, reminding us that they will begin the revolt in exactly 120 days, and that they'd appreciate our support in their operation. Helping them may end up benefiting us, making the newly stablished Russian government more willing to collaborate us in the future, as well as providing us a reliant oil supply, however, nothing assures our win in this war, and most probably the Russian government of Sinkiang will not give us any territories besides Sakhalin, unless of course, we find a way to demand them to do so..."
 chi.55.a:0 "Moscow won't be as lucky as in 1922!"
 chi.55.b:0 "It's not worth the losses."
 chi.56.d:0 "The Japanese government has accepted to support us in our struggle against the government of Moscow. We won't fall this time!"
 chi.56.a:0 "Petrograd shall be ours again!"
 chi.57.d:0 "The Japanese government has ignored our message inviting them to support us in our struggle against the government of Moscow. However, this won't stop us from reclaiming our homeland."
 chi.57.a:0 "We will have to do this alone."
 chi.58.d:0 "Now that the war with the government of Moscow has ended, it is time to demand to Russia our deserved compensation for our support in the Second Russian Civil War, but the question is, what should we ask to the Russians?"
 chi.58.a:0 "We deserve to hold Eastern Russia!"
 chi.58.b:0 "War reparations will be enough."
 chi.59.d:0 "Today we recieved a message from Japan demanding us to transfer them control over the states of the Far East in exchange for the support they provided us in the Second Russian Civil War. We are most probably not strong enough to defeat their army, airforce and navy, and we are not in a position to fight another war in Siberia, but abandoning the people who fought for us in the civil war would surely anger our population, and reduce their support to our government."
 chi.59.a:0 "We have no option..."
 chi.59.b:0 "Maybe they would accept another alternative."
 chi.59.c:0 "We will defend our people until the end!"
 chi.60.d:0 "Today we recieved a message from Japan demanding us to pay them war reparations in exchange for the support they provided us in the Second Russian Civil War. Currently our economy is not at its best state, but they are threatening us with a declaration of war if we refuse, and we are most probably not strong enough to defeat their army, airforce and navy, and we are not in a position to fight another war in Siberia."
 chi.60.a:0 "Well, could be worse..."
 chi.60.b:0 "Are they joking?"
 chi.61.d:0 "The Russian government answered our ultimatum with an interesting proposal: The creation of a buffer state in the Far East. This newly created country would be de iure an autonomous region of Russia, but would mostly function as a totally independent state. We and the Russians will have military access to it and will also guarantee its independence in case of an attack of a foreign country, or from one of us..."
 chi.61.a:0 "Fair enough."
 chi.61.b:0 "This is an insult to our nation! Banzai!"
 chi.62.d:0 "Now that the government of Moscow is not a menace anymore, it is time to restore the tsardom in Russia, but after the assassination of Nicholas the II's family in the Russian Civil War, many Romanov began claiming the throne. Now we have choose: Shall we crown Kyril Romanov, the admiral, or Dmitri Romanov, the cavalry leader?"
 chi.62.a:0 "Kyril Romanov, the admiral!"
 chi.62.b:0  "Dmitri Romanov, the dragoon!"
 chi.63.d:0 "Now that we have seized control over Stalingrad, it is time to change its name to one which is more according to our current administration."
 chi.63.a:0 "Tsaritsyn, like in the old days."
 chi.63.b:0 "Volgograd, for a change."
 chi.63.c:0 "Vrangelgrad, in honour to Wrangel, the black baron."
 chi.64.d:0 "Now that we have seized control over Leningrad, it is time to change its name to one which is more according to our current administration."
 chi.64.a:0 "Saint Petersburg, like Peter the Great wanted."
 chi.64.b:0 "Petrograd, we are not Germans."
 chi.64.c:0 "Denikingrad, in honour to Denikin, one of the saviours of Russia!"
 chi.65.d:0 "Now that we hold control over Russia, we should begin considering were to locate our capital."
 chi.65.a:0 "The north, like in the days of the empire."
 chi.65.b:0 "The center, due to its immense population."
 chi.65.c:0 "The south, protected by forests and rivers."
 chi.66.d:0 "Today, one year after being crowned, Tsar Kyril Romanov passed away, leaving his son, Vladimir Romanov, as the new head of state of Russia."
 chi.66.a:0 "Long live the Tsar!"
 chi.67.d:0 "Today the Russian government has approached us proposing us joining their sphere of influence in exchange of a great amount of economic investiments. Our country's economy is not currently great, and if we refuse we could easily anger them, but is it worth sacrifying our hardly earned independence?"
 chi.67.a:0 "We have no option, don't we?"
 chi.67.b:0 "Our freedom is more important."
 chi.68.d:0 "Today the Russo-Xinjiang rail building mission finished the Alma-ata-Gansu road, greatly increasing our infrastructure in the region."
 chi.68.a:0 "How nice of them!"

 chi.72.b:0 "We have more important matters to attend."
 chi.73.d:0 "Following the terrorist attack in Nanking which ended the life of Chiang Kai-shek and put Wang Jingwei into a coma, Dai Li, leader of the secret police and intelligence force was about to be appointed leader of the nation when Wang's reawakening happened. \n\nIt was said by a nurse that the first words of the premier were "I'll do so, Sun Yat Sen", although it has not been confirmed by Wang itself. \n\nAfter being discharged, the premier was appointed leader of the republic, to then perform a speech in which he stated he would make China follow the three principles of the people, unlike the corrupt government of Chiang."
 chi.73.a:0 "Sun Yat Sen dream will be achieved!"
 chi.75.d:0 "We have recieved a message from China, proposing a non-aggression pact between our nations. In exchange, Wang Jingwei, premier of the republic, has promised to hand us control over numerous ports of the nation, as well as favourable trade for our companies in the nation. How should we respond?"
 chi.75.a:0 "It may satiate us for now..."
 chi.75.b:0 "We have other plans for China."
 chi.76.d:0 "Wang Jingwei was sitting in front of his desk in Wuhan. His leg was shivering due to his nerves, while San Nien by Li Xiang Lan was being played in the radio. \n\nHe jumped from his seat once he heard someone open the door "Premier Wang" said the ingoing officer while performing a military salute, which was answered with a way less enthusiastic one from the premier. "The Japanese have accepted our proposal. Our armies have already began leaving the lent ports, and the tariffs to Japanese companies have already been lowered". Wang sighed, "Thanks for the report. You may leave now" he said, with a smile in his face. \n\n"I'm sorry. But it was the only way to save China" he said to himself once the officer had left, while his smile turned into a grin."
 chi.76.a:0 "We will liberate them eventually..."
 chi.77.d:0 "Wang Jingwei was sitting in front of his desk in Wuhan. His leg was shivering due to his nerves, while San Nien by Li Xiang Lan was being played in the radio. \n\nHe jumped from his seat once he heard someone open the door "Premier Wang" said the ingoing officer while performing a military salute, which was answered with a way less enthusiastic one from the premier. "The Japanese have refused our proposal" he was about to continue talking when he was told to leave by the premier, order that he accepted. After closing the door behind him, he heard a cup of glass being broken by hitting the floor, to then hear the premier screaming blasphemies, all while a distant, calm song was being played in the radio."
 chi.77.a:0 "..."
 chi.78.d:0 "Now that premier Wang Jingwei has taken control over the country, there is only one question to be answered: will the former leader of the left Kuomintang follow his friend Sun Yat Sen's teachings, or will he lean towards his new fascist sympathies?"
 chi.78.a:0 "Sun Yat Sen's dream, will be achieved."
 chi.78.b:0 "Sun Yat Sen's dream, is no more than a fantasy."
 chi.79.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] has proposed us to unite our governments in order to have more opportunities to defeat the government of Nanjing in the next Chinese civil war. However, he states that due to his connections with the Soviet Union and the proximity of [From.Capital.GetName] to that nation, they must be the ones leading this new union. How should we respond?"
 chi.79.a:0 "With their help we will liberate all workers in China!"
 chi.79.b:0 "We have our own path to communism."
 #chi.80.d:0 "Following the opium supression campaign carried out by the Kuomintang and Li Zongren, as well as the new policy towards bandits, triads became being more aggressive towards the armed forces of Guangxi, until one day, it happened. \n\nLi Zongren and Bai Chongxi were shot to death by a gang of youngsters after Li's car was stopped in the mid of the road by the vehicles of the triads. The generals' guards acted quickly, but they were not able to catch all the aggressors, and those who were caught, were either in the edge of death due to their injuries, or commited suicide by the use of cyanide. \n\nSimilar attacks have occurred in other regions of the clique, which almost confirms that this wasn't just some unplanned reprisal."
 #chi.80.a:0 "What's going to be of clique now...?"
 #chi.81.d:0 "Following the opium supression campaign carried out by the Kuomintang and Li Zongren, as well as the new policy towards bandits, triads became being more aggressive towards the armed forces of Guangxi, until one day, it happened. \n\nLi Zongren and Bai Chongxi were shot by a gang of youngsters after Li's car was stopped in the mid of the road by the vehicles of the triads. \n\nNow the two major figures of Guangxi have died, and reports state that many zones of the clique have fell into anarchy. Some of our generals recommend taking action to integrate the clique under our management, but the decisions remains on [ chi.GetLeader]'s hands."
 #chi.81.a:0 "We'll be glad to restore order for them."
 #chi.81.b:0 "We have other matters to attend now."
 chi.80.d:0 "Reports of the Hunan province have arrived Nanjing, stating that troops of the Guangxi Clique have crossed our border an occupied part of the region. Chiang Kai-Shek and Li Zongren are at war once again, just like in the First and Secon Chiang-Gui wars and the Central Plains War. \n\nOur generals have already adviced the generalissimo to begin an offensive in Guangdong, region in which support for Chiang's government is reported to be higher."
 chi.80.a:0 "We will teach them a lesson."
