 MAN_aisin_gioro_puyi_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gFebruary 7th, 1906, in Beijing, Empire of the Great Qing§!\n§YCareer:§! §gPuyi was supposed to be the next emperor of China as he was 1st in line of succession but the emperorship came too early only on December 2nd 1908 after the death of Guangxu Emperor. He became the Xuantong Emperor and same as his 3rd order cousin Guangxu a regency council was put in charge of the country. In this case it wasn't for political reasons but for obviously his age of two in 1908. In 1911 Xinhai Revolution led by Sun Yat-Sen led to his abdication on Febuary 12th 1912 at the age of six. He was allowed to stay in the Forbidden City until 1924 and moved to Tianjin. After 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria he was held captive by the Japanese and given an option to restore the Chinese monarchy under Japanese puppet rule. Starting from Manchuria he has a lot of challanges in front of him (more like his PM)."
