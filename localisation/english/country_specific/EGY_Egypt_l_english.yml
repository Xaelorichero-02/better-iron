 EGY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Egypt remains in a standstill. Almost 15 years have passed since the unilateral declaration of independence from the British Empire, yet latter is still utterly determined to keep the country as a permanent military base in order to safeguard their global empire. The ever more belligerent Italy to the west only reinforces this idea.\n\nEgypt's main aim has always been to gain full independence and establish itself as the dominant power in the region. Perhaps now is the time to embrace desired dreams once and for all?"
