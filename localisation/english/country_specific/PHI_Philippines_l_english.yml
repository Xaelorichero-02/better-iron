 phi.23.d:0 "The Capitania General of Filipinas has sent a delegate from Manila to tell us a proposal. They say that with the increase of popularity of nationalism and communism around the world, colonies all over the world may start thinking about revolting against their overlords, and due to the instability of many European nations due to economic problems and wars, they may succeed. Therefore, they say the smartest thing to do would be to make our colonies think they have more autonomy by creating an "Hispanic Union", like some French politicians wanted to do with theirs.
