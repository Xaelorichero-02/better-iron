 redux_canada.1.desc:0 "A beautiful young woman has ascended to the Canadian Throne. Queen Margaret I will serve as our head of state and lead this great nation into the turbulent future. We have placed all our trust with Her Majesty. Parliament will continue to serve at Her pleasure. It is also within her power to dissolve the House of Commons and rule Her new Kingdom absolutely. The choice is Hers."

 redux_canada.2.desc:0 "Her Majesty is unmarried and should remedy that fact sooner rather than later. She is the darling of the civilized world and such admiration has attracted several potential consorts to Ottawa.  Marrying a prince of an established royal house will undoubtedly bring a substantial level of legitimacy to Her Majesty’s new Kingdom."

 redux_canada.3.desc:0 "Like most of the Commonwealth, Canada used to entrust the defence of its maritime sovereignty to the British Royal Navy. Obviously, we cannot rely on Britain any longer. The Royal Canadian Navy is in a sorry state and will need to be built up rapidly if we are to protect Her Majesty’s Kingdom. Admiral DeWolf suggested building a state-of-the-art flagship to help guide the RCN into modernity."
